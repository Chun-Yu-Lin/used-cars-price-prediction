# used-cars-price-prediction
This is a simple showcase of how using **simple linear regression** can help an used-car dealership resolve the probelm of pricing. The notebook consists of a complete working flow that goes from _importing the data_, _conducting EDA_, _cleaning data_, _engineering features_, _selecting models_, _evaluating model performance_, and _stating the business impacts of the outcome_ as well as _the future work_. The whole work was done in less than 24 hours and in an exam, so the content surely is far from being perfect and may contain several defects. However, this project serves as an starting point for my further learning in future projects.
